# WP Stop Forum Spam API
This WordPress plugin does one thing: Connect to Stop Forum Spam's API to block and/or report malicious IPs.

Other WordPress plugins may include this API as one option but they may also try to do several other things. But, what if you are already using spam prevention plugins you like and all you want to do is add Stop Forum Spam on top of everything else? This is your solution.

Optionally, if you use WordFence, this plugin will attempt to add blocked IPs to WordFence's live traffic monitoring.
